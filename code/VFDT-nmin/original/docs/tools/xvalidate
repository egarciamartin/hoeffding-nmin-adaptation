\brief Performs cross validation of a learner on a data set.

You will probably want to use the \ref batchtest tool for large
experiments; xvalidate will help you to quickly test things, perhaps
as a debugging aid.

<p>You can use xvalidate with large datasets, but you will need enough
disk space to hold 'folds' copies of the data.&nbsp; The learner you
use with xvalidate must also be able to work with large datasets.</p>

<p>Xvalidate takes input in <a href="appendixes/c45.htm">C4.5
format</a> and uses \ref folddata, which must be in your path. You use
the -c option to tell xvalidate how to run the learner.
Xvalidate will append the names of the folds of the datasets to the
end of the -c string, the learner must accept the name and read input
appropriately.</p>

<p>Xvalidate expects the learner to output results in the following format: </p>

<p><code>error-rate size</code> </p>

<p>The learner's error rate on the test set, followed by some
whitespace, followed by the size of the learned model (in whatever
unit you want), followed by a newline. </p>

<p>Xvalidate will collect the output of the runs of the learner, average them, and report:</p>

<p><code>mean-error-rate (standard deviation of error rate) mean-size
(standard deviation of size) average-utime (standard deviation of
utime) average-stime (standard deviation of stime)</code></p>

<p>for example:</p>

<p><code>26.111 (5.500) 0.000 (0.000) 0.013 (0.005) 0.010 (0.008)</code></p>

<p>The times are very accurate on UNIX. Under CYGNUS (windows) utime
will be slightly overestimated and stime will be zero.</p>

<h2>Arguments</h2>

- -f &lt;filestem&gt; 
  - Set the name of the dataset (default DF)
- -source &lt;dir&gt; 
  - Set the source data directory (default '.')
- -c &lt;command&gt; 
  - Set the learner command. The name of the dataset will be appended to the end of this string and used to invoke the learner (<strong>This is a required argument</strong>)
- -folds &lt;n&gt; 
  - Sets the number of train/test sets to create (default 10)
- -seed &lt;n&gt; 
  - Sets the random seed, multiple runs with the same seed will
  produce the same datasets (defaults to a random seed).&nbsp; If you
  use a random seed, the value of the randomly selected seed will be
  printed at the start of the run.&nbsp; You can later use that seed
  to repeat the experiment.&nbsp; You can also pass the same seed to
  \ref folddata to recreate the exact test/training sets for closer inspection.
- -v 
  - Can be used multiple times to increase the debugging output 

<h2>Example</h2>
<code>

<p>xvalidate -source datasets/mushroom -f mushroom -folds 15 -seed 100 -c
&quot;mostcommonclass -u -f&quot;</code> </p>

<p>Does 15-fold cross-validation of the 'mostcommonclass' learner on
the dataset called 'mushroom' in the 'datasets/mushroom'
directory.&nbsp; The mostcommonclass learner will be invoked as:
<code>mostcommonclass -u -f &lt;constructed-dataset-name&gt;
</code>for each of the 15 constructed datasets.&nbsp; It will use a
seeded random number generator so the exact experiment could be
reproduced. </p>
