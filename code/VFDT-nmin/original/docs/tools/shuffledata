\brief Randomizes the order of a data set and rewrites it.

shuffledata reads a data set into RAM and outputs it in random
order.  Data sets that do not fit in RAM are difficult to randomize
and VFML does not have a tool to deal with such data sets.

\wish for a version of this tool that works on disk and does not need
to load data into RAM.

<h2>Arguments</h2>

- -f &lt;filestem&gt; 
  - Set the stem name (default DF)
- -fout &lt;filestem&gt; 
  - Set the name of the output dataset (default shuffled)
- -source &lt;dir&gt; 
  - Set the directory that contains the dataset (default '.')
- -target &lt;dir&gt; 
  - Set the directory to contain the output dataset (default '.')
- -seed &lt;seed&gt; 
  - Sets the random seed, multiple runs with the same seed will produce the same datasets (defaults to a random seed)
- -h 
  - Display usage information and exit.
- -v 
  - Can be used multiple times to increase the debugging output
