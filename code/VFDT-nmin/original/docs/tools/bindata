\brief Converts continuous attributes into discrete ones.

Converts all continuous attributes in a data set to categorical
ones.  Uses two passes over data, one to gather the stats needed to
pick bin boundaries, and one to do the conversion (although the first
pass can be done on a sample with the -samples argument below).

bindata uses one of two methods to select bin boundaries.  The
first is to find the range of each attribute (by identifing its
highest and lowest value) and then dividing the range into even with
bins.  This is the default method.  The other method assumes that the
attribute was generated from a Gaussian, estimates the mean and
variance of the Gaussian from data, and sets bin boundaries so that
each bin holds an even amount of the Gaussian's probability mass.

\thanks to Chun-Hsiang Hung for doing the core development work for
this tool.

\wish that this tool would have more methods for selecting bin
boundaries, for example to reduce entropy.

<h2>Arguments</h2>

- -f &lt;filestem&gt; 
  - Set the stem name (default DF)
- -fout &lt;filestem&gt; 
  - Set the name of the output dataset (default DF-out)
- -source &lt;dir&gt; 
  - Set the directory that contains the dataset (default '.')
- -target &lt;dir&gt; 
  - Set the directory to contain the output dataset (default '.')
- -test 
  - Also converts the test set (but does not use the test set to
  pick boundaries)
- -samples &lt;n&gt; 
  - Use the first n examples to pick bin boundaries (default use the whole
  train set)
- -bins &lt;n&gt; 
  - Sets the number of bins (default 10)
- -gaussian
  - Pick bin boundaries by fitting a Gaussian and making even
  probability bins
- -h
  - Display usage information and exit.
- -v 
  - Can be used multiple times to increase the debugging output
