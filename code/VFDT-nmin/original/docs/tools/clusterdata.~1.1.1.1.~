\brief Creates a synthetic data set from randomly generated clusters.

<p>This program creates a synthetic data set by selecting cluster
centroids and generating samples by ranomly picking a centroid and
sampling from a spherical gaussian with the centroid as its mean and a
user specified standard deviation.  This data generator has been used
to evaluate the VFKM and VFEM systems.</p>

<p>

The centroids are randomly placed uniformly in a N dimensional unit
hypercube (where N is the number of continuous dimensions), except
that if any centroid is placed closer than: <code>(sqrt(N) / (num
centroids + 1)) * std deviation </code> to an already placed one its
location is resampled.  (If any centroid can not be placed after 1000
resamples and error is reported.)  Note that 'unit hypercube' means
that each dimension ranges from 0 - 1.0.

<p>

Finally, training samples are generated by randomly selecting a
centroid and sampling from a Gaussian with it as the mean and the
specified standard deviation (specified by a parameter to the program)
for each dimension.  Note that the value of a sample's dimension may
fall outside the 0 - 1.0 range.

<p>Creates 1000 samples in 20 dimensions by sampling from a mixture of
3 Gaussians with a standard deviation of 0.05.  This same data set
could be recreated by using the same <i>seed</i> and
<i>conceptSeed</i> flags.
