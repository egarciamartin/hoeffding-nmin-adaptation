\brief Cleans up a data set in several ways.

<p>This tool cleans a data set in several ways, and outputs the
cleaned data.  It will scan the training data and gather some
simple stats about it (if needed, see below).  It then does a pass
over training and testing data, filling in missing categorical
attribute values with the most common value given the class, and
filling in missing continuous attribute values with the average value
given the class.

<p>The tool can also add a new attribute value to each categorical
attribe, called 'u' (short for unknown) and rewrite the data set as
appropriate.

<p>The tool can also remove every attribute in the data set that is
marked ignored.

<P>cleandata accepts an input stem and expects to find a file
<i>stem</i>.data and <i>stem</i>.names and optionally one called
<i>stem</i>.test.  cleandata outputs a file named
<i>stem</i>-clean.data, <i>stem</i>-clean.names, and optionally
<i>stem</i>-clan.test.

<p>cleandata will work with a single pass over the data set if and
only if you use -addValue and there are no continuous attributes.
Otherwise it usues an additional pass.

\thanks to Chun-Hsiang Hung for doing the core development work for
this tool.
