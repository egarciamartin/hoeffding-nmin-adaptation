\brief Creates a data set by sampling from a Bayesian Network.

>This program creates a synthetic data set by loading an existing
belief network (in <A HREF="appendixes/bif.htm">BIF format</a>) and
sampling from it, possibly introducing noise.  This program will also
create a .names file for the resulting data set.  More specifically,
belifnetdata reads the network, generates samples from it with
<strong>BNGenerateSample</strong>, and adds noise to them (if
requested) with <strong>ExampleAddNoise</strong>. 

<p> Multiple runs with the same seed parameter produce the same
results.  Also note that running this command with one level of -v
will output some statistics about the belif net which you might find
useful.

<p>VFML comes with a collection of benchmark belief nets, and you may
want <a href="appendixes/beliefnets.htm">more information on these</a>.

<h2>Example</h2>

<p><code>

beliefnetdata -f train -bnf alarm.bif -train 1000 -seed 111 -noise 5</code></p>

<p>Creates 1000 samples from the alarm network, randomly corrupts 5%
of their values, write the resulting samples to train.data (and create
a file train.names) and reproduce the same data set everytime the same
arguments are used (thanks to the seed parameter)
