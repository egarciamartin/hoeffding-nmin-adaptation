\brief Tests a BeliefNet in several ways.


<p>This program determines the log-likelihood of a data set given a
belief net.  It can also compare the structure of two networks.  In
log-likelihood mode it loads the belief net, and then scans the data
set, accumulating the likelihood of each example in the data set given
the network.

<p>beliefnetscore can smooth the parameters in the network before
computing this likelihood.  (Run beliefnetscore -h for the precice
parameters to use.)  This smoothing works as follows.  Each
parameter in the network is multiplied by the desired strength, and
then 1 is added to each local model is renormalized.  If you do not
use this argument, and there is a 0 probability in the network, but
that even occurs in the data set, beliefnetscore will crash.

<p>In comparison mode it loads both networks and the outputs the
structural difference between the two networks.  This is sometimes
known as the symetric difference and is measured by iterating over the
nodes in each network and counting the number of times that the node
has a parent that the coresponding node in the other network does not
have.

\wish Move the comparision mode from this tool into a new tool,
beliefnetcompare, and have that tool do more interesting comparisions
(e.g. measure the KL-distance between the distriutions encoded in the
networks).
