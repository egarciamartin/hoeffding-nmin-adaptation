\brief Predicts the most common class in the training data.

This is a very simple 'learner', but it may be useful as a baseline to
compare your learner against; predicting with 99% accuracy isn't
impressive if 98% of the examples have the same class.

The mostcommonclass learner works in time proportional to the number
of training examples and uses space proportional to the number of
classes.&nbsp; It should be able to work on large datasets.</p>

<p>The learner takes input and does output in <a
href="../appendixes/c45.htm">c4.5 format</a>.  &nbsp; It expects to
find the files <code>&lt;stem&gt;.names</code> and
<code>&lt;stem&gt;.data.</code> Depending on command line argument, it
will either output the most common class or test its error rate on
<code>&lt;stem&gt;.test</code>.</p>

<h2>Arguments</h2>

- -f &lt;filestem&gt; </dt>
  - Set the stem name (default DF)<br>
- -source &lt;dir&gt; </dt>
  - Set the directory that contains the dataset (default '.')<br>
- -u </dt>
  - Test on the examples in &lt;stem&gt;.test and output in a format appropriate for interface with xvalidate and batchtest&nbsp; (defaults to off)<br>
- -v </dt>
  - Can be used multiple times to increase the debugging output </dd>

<h2>Example</h2>

<code>mostcommonclass -f banana -source datasets/banana</code>

Looks for a dataset named 'banana' in the 'datasets/banana'
directory.&nbsp; Outputs the name of the most common class in the
dataset.
