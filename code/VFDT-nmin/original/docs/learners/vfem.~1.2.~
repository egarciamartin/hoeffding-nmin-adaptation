\brief Performs EM clustering.

<p>Performs EM clustering for sphirical gaussians accelerated with
sampling as described in <a
href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/541935.html">this paper</a>.  This
learner ignores categorical attributes.

<p>VFEM takes input and does output in <a
href="../appendixes/c45.htm">c4.5 format</a>. It expects to find the
files <code>&lt;stem&gt;.names</code> and
<code>&lt;stem&gt;.data.</code> and outputs the learned centers to a
file called <code>&lt;stem&gt;.centers</code>.

<p>It evaluates the learned centers by comparing to the centers found in
&lt;stem&gt;.test as follows.  Learned centers are greedily matched to
the closest of the test centers until each center has a match, and
then the evaluation is the sum of the squared distance between each
test center and its matched learned center.
