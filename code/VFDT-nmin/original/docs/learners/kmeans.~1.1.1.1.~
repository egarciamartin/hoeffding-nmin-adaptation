\brief Performs k-means clustering.

Performs k-mean clustering on the continuous attributes in a data
set (ignoring any discrete attributes).

<p>The learner takes input and does output in <a
href="../appendixes/c45.htm">c4.5 format</a>. It expects to find the
files <code>&lt;stem&gt;.names</code> and
<code>&lt;stem&gt;.data.</code> and outputs the learned centers to a
file called <code>&lt;stem&gt;.centers</code>.

<p>Evaluates the learned centers by comparing to the centers found in
&lt;stem&gt;.test as follows.  Learned centers are greedily matched to
the closest of the test centers until each center has a match, and
then the evaluation is the sum of the squared distance between each
test center and its matched learned center.

<p>You can find a more full-featured kmeans clustering algorithm by
running \ref vfkm with the -batch argument (for
example you can set initial centroid locations, etc.

\wish Modify this learner to work with discrete attributes.
\wish Move the features from \ref vfkm into this learner because this
learner will be much easier to modify than that one for new users.

<h2>Arguments</h2>

- -f &lt;filestem&gt; 
  - Set the stem name (default DF)
- -source &lt;dir&gt; 
  - Set the directory that contains the dataset (default '.')
- -clusters  &lt;dir&gt; 
  - Sets the number of clusters to look for, this argument is required.
- -threshold  &lt;threshold&gt; 
  - Iterate until every centroid moves less than this threshold.
- -u 
  - Test by comparing to the centroids in &lt;threshold&gt;.test 
- -v 
  - Can be used multiple times to increase the debugging output
