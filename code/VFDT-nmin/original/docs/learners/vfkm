\brief Performs k-means clustering accelerated with sampling

Performs k-mean clustering accelerated with sampling as described in
<a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/domingos01general.html">this
paper</a>.  This learner ignores categorical attributes.  vfkm
performs several iterations of clustering on progressively larger
samples until it determines with high confidence (see -delta below)
that the clustering it achieves is within -epsilon of the one that
would be achieved using infinite data for each decision.  vfkm can use
a fancy optimization to select the number of samples to use in each
iteration of the next round, or it can use straight progressive
sampling.  You can use the -batch argument to turn off the sampling
and do traditional k-means clustering.  vfkm evaluates the learned
centers by comparing to the centers found in &lt;stem&gt;.test as
follows.  Learned centers are greedily matched to the closest of the
test centers until each center has a match, and then the evaluation is
the sum of the squared distance between each test center and its
matched learned center.

The learner takes input and does output in <a
href="../appendixes/c45.htm">c4.5 format</a>. It expects to find the
files <code>&lt;stem&gt;.names</code> and
<code>&lt;stem&gt;.data.</code> and outputs the learned centers to a
file called <code>&lt;stem&gt;.centers</code>.


<h2>Arguments</h2>

- -f 'filestem'
  - Set the name of the dataset (default DF)
- -source 'dir'
  - Set the source data directory (default '.')
- -clusters 'numClusters'
  - Set the num clusters to find (REQUIRED)
- -dbSize 'examples'
  - How many examples are in the datafile (REQUIRED)
- -assignErrorScale 'scale'
  - Loosen bound by scaling the assignment part of it by the scale factor (default 1.0)
- -delta 'delta'
  - Find final solution with confidence (1 - 'delta') (default 5%)
- -epsilon 'epsilon'
  - The maximum distance between a learned centroid and the coresponding infinite data centroid (default .05)
- -converge 'distance'
  - Stop when distance centroids move between iterations squared is less than 'distance'  (default .001)
- -batch
  - Do a traditional kmeans run on the whole input file.  Doesn't make sense to combine with -stdin (default off)
- -init 'num'
  - Use the 'num'th valid assignment of initial centroids (default 1)
- -maxPerIteration 'num'
  - Use no more than num examples per iteration (default 1,000,000,000)
-l 'number'
  - The estimated # of iterations to converge if you guess wrong and aren't using batch VFKM will fix it for you and do an extra round (default 10)
- -seed 's'
  - Seed to use picking initial centers (default random)
- -progressive
  - Don't use our fancy Lagrange based optimization pick the # of samples at each iteration of the next round (default use the optimization)
- -allowBadConverge
  - Allows VFKM to converge at a time when km would not (default off).
- -normalApprox
  - Use a normal approximation instead of the hoeffding bound (default hoeffding).
- -r 'range'
  - The maximum range between pairs of examples (default assume the range of each dimension is 0 - 1.0 and calculate it from that)
- -stdin
  - Reads training examples as a stream from stdin instead of from 'stem'.data (default off)
- -testOnTrain 
  - Loss is the sum of the square of the distances from all training examples to their assigned centroid (default compare learned centroids to centroids in 'stem'.test)
- -loadCenters
  - Load initial centroids from 'stem'.centers (default use random based on -init and -seed)
- -u
  - Output results after each iteration
- -v
  - Can be used multiple times to increase the debugging output
- -h 
  - Run vfkm -h for a list of the arguments and their meanings.
