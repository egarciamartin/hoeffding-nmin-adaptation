\brief Learns a decision stump (a DecisionTree with only one split).

This is a very simple learner, but it may be useful as a baseline
to compare your learner against.

<p>The decisionstump learner works in time proportional to the number
of training examples.  It also requires memory that is proportional to
the number of classes * number attributes * number of values.  Note
that this can be very large for continuous attributes (which, in the
worst case, have a separate value for each training example).  The
maxThresholds argument can be used to control this.</p>

<p>The learner takes input and does output in <a
href="../appendixes/c45.htm">c4.5 format</a>.  &nbsp; It expects to
find the files <code>&lt;stem&gt;.names</code> and
<code>&lt;stem&gt;.data.</code> Depending on command line argument, it
will either output the decision stump or test its error rate on
<code>&lt;stem&gt;.test</code>.</p>

<h2>Arguments</h2>

- -f &lt;filestem&gt;
  - Set the stem name (default DF)
- -source &lt;dir&gt;
  - Set the directory that contains the dataset (default '.')
- -u 
  - Test on the examples in &lt;stem&gt;.test and output in a format appropriate for interface with xvalidate and batchtest&nbsp; (defaults to off)
- -a
  - Outputs the name of the selected attribute
- -outputGains
  - Outputs the information gain (and best threshold) for each attribute
- -outputStump
  - Prints the learned stump.  Defaults to output without the -u flag
  and not output with it
- -maxThresholds &lt;num&gt;
  - Use the first num values from the training set as thresholds
  for continuous attributes, allows this program to be run on very
  large data sets (default use all values)
- -v 
  - Can be used multiple times to increase the debugging output

<h2>Example</h2>

<code>decisionstump -f banana -source datasets/banana</code>

Looks for a dataset named 'banana' in the 'datasets/banana'
directory.&nbsp; Outputs the decision stump learned from the data set.
