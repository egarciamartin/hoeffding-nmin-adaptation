\brief Calls C5.0 and tests the learned tree.

A wrapper that calls C5.0 to learn a decision tree, times its
  execution, and extracts the important bits from its output.  C5.0
  must be in your path for this learner to work.  It is a commercial
  product and you can get information about purchasing it from
  Professor Quinlan's homepage at <a
  href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~quinlan/">http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~quinlan/</a>.

<p>This wrapper runs C5.0, tests the lerned tree on the test data (if
appropriate) and outputs: <code>test set error rate &lt;whitespace&gt;
size of tree &lt;whitespace&gt; seconds</code>.
