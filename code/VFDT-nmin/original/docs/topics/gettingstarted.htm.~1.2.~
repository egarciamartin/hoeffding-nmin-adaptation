<h1>Getting Started with VFML</h1>

<p>At its core, VFML contains a library that you will need to compile
and link with your programs.&nbsp; VFML has a set of interfaces
through which you access the functionality of the library.&nbsp; It
also contains a few programs which should help you with your machine
learning tasks.</p>

<p>The best way to get the most recent version of VFML is to download
it from the CVS server on our sourceforge.net project page.  You can
find the summary of the project at <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vfml/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/vfml/</a>
and information about getting CVS access at <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=85301">https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=85301</a>.
The module name is <code>vfml</code> so the following commands should
work (simply press 'enter' if asked for a password):

<pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/vfml login 
 
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/vfml co vfml
</pre>

<p>Alternately you can download the code in <a
href="../downloads/vfml.tar.gz">tar.gz format</a> or in <a
href="../downloads/vfml.zip">zip format</a>, but these may not be as
up-to-date as the version at sourceforge.

<h2>Getting Started with UNIX</h2>

<p>VFML was developed and tested with Linux.  It should compile easily
under any UNIX.  If it doesn't work for you please send us a bug
report.  Once you have the source take the following steps to compile it:


<ol>
  <li>change directory into the distribution directory</li>
  <li>edit the makefile so that the correct arch is uncommented (try Unix if none of the others fit)</li>
  <li>type make</li>
  <li>add the <code>&lt;distribution&gt;/bin</code> directory to your path</li>
</ol>

<p>Once that is done, you might like to check out the <a
href="../examples/implement-learner.htm">implement-learner</a>
example, which contains a starter project and makefile.  It should
help get you started.</p>

<h2>Getting Started with Windows</h2>

<p>If you have <a
href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/mirrors.html">Cygnus</a>
installed, follow the UNIX getting started instructions (if you don't
have Cygnus installed you might consider it - it's free!)</p>

<p>VFML was developed on Linux, but is written with standard C and
should work in other environments.  For non-cygnus windows try the
following:

<p>The <a
href="../examples/implement-learner.htm">implement-learner</a> example
contains a VC++6.0 project which should help get you started.&nbsp;
You might need to change some of the configurations and paths
depending on where you installed the VFML distribution - the sample
project file assumes you installed VFML as c:/proj/vfml. &nbsp; Here
are the steps that were used to create this VC++ project: &nbsp;

<ul>
  <li>Create a new project, a win32 console application with a simple-app</li>
  <li>Remove the starter file they gave you: <code>&lt;projectname&gt;.cpp </code>(select the file and press the DEL key)</li>
  <li>Switch to <strong>File View</strong> on the left.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Add all the source and include files from the: include, src, src/core, src/util, and src/windows directories to the project</li>
  <li>Turn off pre-compiled headers for all the source files by doing the following:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>From the <strong>Project</strong> menu, select <strong>Settings ...</strong>. </li>
    <li>Make sure the <strong>Settings for</strong> selection reflects the project you are
      building. By default, this will likely be &quot;Win32 Debug&quot;. </li>
    <li>Expand the <strong>Source Files</strong> folder in the list on the left, and
      control-click to select all the source files you just added to the project. </li>
    <li>On the right, select the <strong>C/C++</strong> tab. </li>
    <li>In the <strong>Category</strong> combo box, select <strong>Precompiled headers</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>Select the <strong>Not using precompiled headers</strong> option. </li>
    <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to close the project settings dialog. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Now add additional include directories</li>
  <ul>
    <li>From the <strong>Project</strong> menu, select <strong>Settings ...</strong>. </li>
    <li>Make sure the <strong>Settings for</strong> selection reflects the project you are
      building. By default, this will likely be &quot;Win32 Debug&quot;. </li>
    <li>Expand the <strong>Source Files</strong> folder in the list on the left, and
      control-click to select all the source files you just added to the project. </li>
    <li>On the right, select the <strong>C/C++</strong> tab. </li>
    <li>In the <strong>Category</strong> combo box, select <strong>Preprocessor</strong>. </li>
    <li>In the <strong>Additional Include Directories</strong> box, add in (separated by
      commas):</li>
    <ul>
      <li><code>&lt;VFML-root&gt;/include</code></li>
      <li><code>&lt;VFML-root&gt;/src</code></li>
      <li><code>&lt;VFML-root&gt;/src/core</code></li>
      <li><code>&lt;VFML-root&gt;/src/util</code></li>
      <li><code>&lt;VFML-root&gt;/src/windows</code></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to close the project settings dialog.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>As you add new files to your project make sure you update their precompiled headers and include directory settings as described just above.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started with C++</h2>

<p>VFML will work with C++, just remember that you need to let your
compiler know that VFML is written in C.&nbsp; For example, you need
to use the following statement to include vfml.h into a C++ files:</p>

<code>
<p>extern &quot;C&quot; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; #include &quot;vfml.h&quot;<br>
}<br>
</code></p>

<h2>Getting Datasets</h2>

<p>We have converted a bunch of the UCI-repository <a
href="../appendixes/ucidatasets.htm">uci datasets</a> to <a
href="../appendixes/c45.htm">C4.5 format</a> for use with VFML.&nbsp;
You should download them, and put them in the same directory that
contains the VFML distribution directory.</p>
