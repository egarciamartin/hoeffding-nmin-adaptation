## AVFDT
==============
*avfdt.c* and *vfdt-engine.c* files modified with the new adaptive, energy-efficient algorithm

# Version with markers
*avfdtm.c* and *vfdt-enginem.c*
Markers around the most important functions. To get the energy consumption per function

# Version without markers
*avdt.c* and *vfdt-engine.c*
Without markers. For the final experiments to compare AVFDT vs VFDT
