Very Fast Machine Learning Toolkit

Based on original work by Hulten, G. and Domingos, P. "VFML -- A toolkit for mining high-speed time-changing data streams" http://www.cs.washington.edu/dm/vfml/. 2003.

This repository contains minor bug fixes and tweaks to the build process (specifically to allow the code to compile under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS).

Welcome to the VFML Very Fast Machine Learning toolkit.  To make just
edit the top of the makefile and type 'make'.  This puts all compiled
binaries into the vfml/bin dir.  Move them where you want them.

The programs in VFML prints out usage instructions when given the '-h'
argument.  You can find man pages for everything in VFML in
'man/man3/*'. There is also more substantial web based documentation
at:

Enjoy!
